- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on literally any machine learning project. I love Machine Learning and I'd totally love to help out anywhere I can!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with molecular dynamics. I've been meaning to write a computational chemistry/physics engine for fun, and I'd love some help with the physics of it.
