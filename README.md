- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Quantum Computing and Physical Modeling
- ðŸŒ± I'm presently learning about the WebGPU specification and using with [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on literally any machine learning project. I love Machine Learning and I'd totally love to help out anywhere I can!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with molecular dynamics (or computational fluid dynamics). I've been meaning to write a computational chemistry/physics engine for fun, and I'd love some help working through all the physics of it.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about musicals! I know GitHub is primarily for code and whatnot, but if you have suggestions for musicals, or just want to chill and discuss music, feel free to DM me!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
  - Email: arvin.singh.kushwaha@gmail.com
