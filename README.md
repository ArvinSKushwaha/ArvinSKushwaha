### Hi there 👋 I'm Arvin Kushwaha!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Differentiable Path Tracing
- 🌱 I'm presently learning about synthesizing carbon allotropes! It's pretty cool, check it out!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on literally any machine learning project. I love Machine Learning and I'd totally love to help out anywhere I can!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with molecular dynamics. I've been meaning to write a computational chemistry/physics engine for fun, and I'd love some help with the physics of it.
- 💬 Ask me about musicals! I know GitHub is primarily for code and whatnot, but if you have suggestions for musicals, or just want to chill and discuss music, feel free to DM me!
- 📫 How to reach me: 
  - Email: arvin.singh.kushwaha@gmail.com
